Act as a world-class UI/UX Designer and Expert React Developer. Your task is to build a premium, highly unique, and immersive landing page for a mobile app startup called "toMedina". 

**Project Context:**
toMedina is a sustainable, immersive mobile app that helps travelers explore ancient Moroccan medinas not as tourists, but as locals. The primary goal of this landing page is to showcase the app's beautiful UI and drive users to download the app on the App Store and Google Play. 

**Tech Stack:**
- React (Functional components, React hooks)
- Tailwind CSS (for all styling, animations, and responsive design)
- Lucide React (for icons)

**Design System & Art Direction (CRITICAL):**
I DO NOT want a generic SaaS template. The design must feel authentic, premium, and culturally rooted, while remaining modern, fast, and conversion-focused for app downloads.
- **Colors:** Primary Deep Forest Green (e.g., bg-emerald-900 or #0D4732), Background Cream/Beige (e.g., bg-[#F5F2EB]), and warm gold/brass accents.
- **Shapes:** Do not use standard rounded corners everywhere. Use asymmetrical border-radiuses or shapes that subtly mimic the traditional Moorish arch (e.g., `rounded-t-full` combined with square bottom corners for image containers and phone mockups).
- **Textures:** Use subtle geometric background patterns (Zellige/Moroccan star patterns) applied with low opacity (5-10%) over the green sections.
- **Typography:** A sophisticated serif for large headings (to convey history and culture) and a clean, highly legible sans-serif for body text. 
- **Layout:** Use overlapping elements, asymmetrical grids, and plenty of negative space to create an editorial, magazine-like feel.

**Page Structure & Sections:**

1. **Transparent Navbar:**
   - Left: "toMedina" logo text (bold, sans-serif).
   - Right: "Download App" button (pill-shaped, solid green on cream bg).

2. **Hero Section (Immersive & App-Focused):**
   - Split layout. 
   - Left: Headline: "Explore Not as a Tourist, But as a Local." (Large serif font). Subheadline: "The medina is a living story. Download the toMedina app to turn an overwhelming maze into a personalized, deeply engaging journey." Below this, prominently feature App Store and Google Play download badges.
   - Right: A visual of a sleek, modern smartphone mockup displaying the toMedina app interface. Frame this phone mockup within a beautiful Moorish arch shape, slightly overlapping the next section to break the grid.

3. **The Problem vs. The Solution (The Magic vs. The Maze):**
   - A side-by-side comparison section. 
   - Left (The Maze): Subtle red/orange warning tones. "Navigation is overwhelming. The experience is a stressful maze or a superficial checklist."
   - Right (The Magic): Green/calm tones. "The Gateway to Authenticity. Discover multi-generational artisans and hidden gems with a personalized roadmap right in your pocket."

4. **Features (Interactive & UI-Driven):**
   - Use an alternating zig-zag layout (Text on left/Phone mockup on right, then swapped). 
   - Feature 1: "Curated, Dynamic Roadmaps" (Icon: Map/Compass). Emphasize routes based on budget, time, and themes. Visual: Phone mockup showing a custom route on a map.
   - Feature 2: "The AI-Powered Local Friend" (Icon: Message Bubble/Sparkles). It walks by your side, tells stories, and adapts in real-time. Visual: Phone mockup showing the AI chat interface over a camera view.
   - Feature 3: "Hyper-Personalization" (Icon: Sliders/User). Matches your pace, interests, and group size.

5. **Sustainable Economics Banner (High Impact):**
   - Full-width deep green background with a subtle geometric pattern.
   - White/Cream text.
   - Headline: "Sustainable Economics."
   - Body: "Unlocking heritage while ensuring tourism dollars directly benefit the host communities. We drive foot traffic to the real local economy."
   - Include a large, beautiful image of a local artisan (e.g., a brass worker or weaver) blending softly into the background.

6. **Final App Download CTA:**
   - Centered layout.
   - Headline: "Belong to the Story."
   - Subheadline: "Download toMedina today and step into the authentic heart of Morocco."
   - Large App Store and Google Play buttons.

7. **Footer:**
   - Clean, minimal. 
   - Links: Home, About Us, Privacy Policy, Contact.
   - Copyright 2026 toMedina.

**Execution Rules:**
- Write clean, production-ready React code.
- Ensure the layout is fully responsive (mobile-first approach).
- Use Tailwind's arbitrary values (e.g., `h-[500px]`, `rounded-tr-[100px]`) to achieve the unique architectural shapes.
- Use simple stylized CSS shapes (like a bordered rounded rectangle) to represent the smartphone mockups if you don't use external image assets.
- Include subtle hover states and CSS transitions for a polished feel.
- Use Unsplash source URLs for placeholder images (e.g., `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1539020140153-e479b8c22e70?auto=format&fit=crop&q=80` for a Moroccan medina).
